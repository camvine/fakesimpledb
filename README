Test implementation of simpledb's API that maps on an sqlite database
per domain. It follows the API specified here:

http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2009-04-15/DeveloperGuide/

Requires jinja2, cherrypy, and sqlite3

A number of caveats:

* Currently doesn't do any limiting properly
* Assumes that your attribute values will always be consistent per domain
* Only does minimal error simulation currently
* Needs a lot of testing...

You should be able to NULL attributes but don't support that yet.
